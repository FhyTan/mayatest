## Maya Unit Test

Original work by [Chad Vernon](https://github.com/chadmv) as part of his CMT toolset: https://github.com/chadmv/cmt

Python unit testing inside of Autodesk Maya. Unit testing is a good thing. This tool makes it easier to test your VFX and game tools inside of Autodesk Maya. This tool could also be modified to run in Nuke to unit test python scripts in that DCC package.

This one has just the unit testing part and works on regular python modules loaded into Maya.
